             "spring-fields-prep",
             "Early spring is the most critical window for soil preparation. At Green Valley Farm we begin our season with a thorough soil test on every field, then work through a disciplined five-step prep sequence before the first seed goes in.\n\n"
             "Step one is drainage inspection. Walk every field perimeter and look for standing water or poorly draining low spots. A wet spring compounds quickly — water-logged soil destroys soil structure, delays planting, and sets you back four to six weeks.\n\n"
             "Step two is cover crop termination. We planted cereal rye at 60 lbs/acre last October. By early April it's at 12–18 inches and we roll-crimp it flat. Thirty days later the residue has broken down enough to transplant into without nitrogen tie-up.\n\n"
             "Step three is lime application. Our sandy loam soils drift acid over winter. We target pH 6.4 for brassicas and 6.8 for corn ground. Apply now so three months of rain can work it into the profile before planting.\n\n"
             "Step four is pre-plant fertilizer. We inject 4 gallons per acre of fish emulsion (4-2-2) at transplanting. For our heavier feeders — brassicas, squash — we band compost at 2 tons/acre before bedding.\n\n"
             "Step five is bed formation. We use a BCS walk-behind with a bed former for our market garden and a three-point power ridger for field-scale rows. Consistent 30-inch centers keep our cultivation tractor straddling without guesswork."),

            ("Why We Switched to Regenerative Grazing — And What Changed",
             "regenerative-grazing-results",
             "Three years ago our pastures looked like every other farm in the county: overgrazed, weedy, with bare patches spreading every dry summer. We made the decision to move to a full rotational system and the results have been dramatic enough that we want to share the numbers.\n\n"
             "Year one: We divided our 80 acres of pasture into 12 paddocks using temporary electric fence. Rest periods averaged 42 days. Forage dry matter yield measured by rising plate meter increased 18% over the prior year's same-period estimate.\n\n"
             "Year two: We added a water system with a central pump and frost-free nose pumps in each paddock. Cattle no longer had to walk to a single corner waterer — animal performance improved and soil compaction near the old waterer began recovering. Soil organic matter readings (sent to a lab at the same time of year) went from 2.1% to 2.7%.\n\n"
             "Year three (current): We're running 12% more animal units on the same acreage with better body condition scores going into winter. We've eliminated 100% of our herbicide applications — the rest periods and dense sward simply outcompete the weeds. Our vet bill dropped 22% compared to our three-year average before the transition.\n\n"
             "The hardest part was the discipline of moving cattle every 4–6 days instead of letting them stay until the paddock was eaten down to dirt. That muscle memory took one full season to build."),

            ("Our CSA Model: How We Price Shares and What Members Actually Get",

             "We run two CSA tracks: a Full Share designed for families of four, and a Half Share for couples or single-person households. Both run 22 weeks from May through October.\n\n"
             "Full Share pricing: $620 for the season, paid upfront, or $290 per half-season. Members receive a box averaging 12–14 items each week. In peak summer that means corn, tomatoes, zucchini, cucumbers, basil, peppers, green beans, eggplant, and whatever specialty items are at their peak. Early and late season the box shifts to storage crops, greens, and root vegetables.\n\n"
             "Half Share: $340 for the season. Same diversity but roughly 60% of the volume — good for households that supplement at the farmers market or don't cook every night.\n\n"
             "Add-ons: Members can add a flower share ($8/week), an egg share (one dozen per week, $7), or a honey jar bi-weekly ($12 per jar). About 40% of our members take at least one add-on.\n\n"
             "How we plan the box: Every Thursday we walk every field and measure what's ready. On Friday morning we build the box list based on availability, trying to hit a balanced mix of items most members will use immediately versus items that store for a week. We write the week's growing notes in our member newsletter — what pest pressure we're seeing, what's coming in two weeks, recipe suggestions for the harder-to-use items like kohlrabi.\n\n"
             "Member retention: We currently retain 81% of members season over season. The most common reason for not returning is moving out of the area, not dissatisfaction with the product."),

            ("Soil Testing on a Budget: What to Order, When, and How to Read It",
             "soil-testing-budget",
             "We get asked constantly how much we spend on soil testing and whether it's worth it for a smaller operation. Here's our honest answer: we spend $340 per year on soil tests across 14 fields and every dollar of that comes back multiplied in fertilizer we didn't have to buy.\n\n"
             "Our testing calendar: We pull samples in early October after fall harvest and before we apply any amendments. October samples reflect the season's depletion and give us the full winter to plan amendments without the spring rush.\n\n"
             "What we order: A standard panel (pH, organic matter, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, CEC) at $18/sample from our state extension lab. We add the micronutrient panel ($28 extra) on fields that have shown deficiency symptoms in the past three years — currently five fields.\n\n"
             "Reading the results: The most important number is pH. Everything else responds to pH. If your pH is below 6.0, fix that first before spending anything on nutrients. Second priority is organic matter — below 2% means your soil biology is struggling and any synthetic fertilizer you apply will perform below label rate.\n\n"
             "Phosphorus: Most extension labs use the Mehlich-3 extraction method. If your P is above 100 ppm Mehlich-3, you have enough for most crops and should focus on other nutrients. Below 20 ppm you're likely seeing yield drag.\n\n"
             "Cation ratios: We've moved away from the base saturation ratio approach that was popular 20 years ago. The research since then shows that getting the individual elements into the sufficiency range matters more than hitting specific ratios. Keep Ca above 70% saturation, Mg 10–20%, K 2–5%, and Na below 3%."),

             "food-safety-plan",
             "When we started selling to restaurants and a regional co-op, food safety documentation became non-negotiable. Here's the core of our plan — not the legal boilerplate, but the actual practices we've built into daily farm life.\n\n"
             "Water testing: We test our irrigation water source quarterly. The test goes to a state-certified lab and checks total coliform, E. coli, and nitrate. We've had clean results every test, but the documentation is what our buyers require. If we ever fail a coliform test, our protocol is to switch to overhead irrigation only (not drip on edible portions), notify buyers, and retest before resuming normal practice.\n\n"
             "Worker health and hygiene: Every person who harvests, packs, or handles produce has completed our food safety training, which includes hand washing protocol, what to do if they're sick, and not to work with open wounds in harvest areas. Training is documented with a signed acknowledgment sheet.\n\n"
             "Harvest containers: All harvest totes are washed with a quaternary ammonium sanitizer at the end of every day and allowed to air dry. We don't stack wet totes.\n\n"
             "Temperature management: Leafy greens and basil go into the cooler within 30 minutes of harvest. We target cooler temperature of 34-36 degrees F. We log the cooler temperature twice daily.\n\n"
             "Traceability: Every harvest lot gets a date, field ID, and crop label. If a buyer ever needs to trace a product back, we can identify the field, the harvest date, who harvested it, and what went into which box within 20 minutes.\n\n"
             "Wildlife management: We've installed bird exclusion netting over our wash station and checked our field perimeter for evidence of large animal intrusion (deer breaks in fencing, feral pig activity). We document field inspections before harvest.")

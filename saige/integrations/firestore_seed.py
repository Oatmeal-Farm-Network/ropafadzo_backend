            "improved soil health, and more even manure distribution. "

            "Move when grass is grazed to 3-4 inches (never below). Rest period varies by season and growth rate. "

            "Excellent for soil building but requires daily management and water access in each cell. "

            "Water is the most critical nutrient. Livestock with restricted water intake reduce feed intake by 50% within days. "
            "DAILY REQUIREMENTS: Dairy cow (lactating) 30-50 gallons, beef cow 10-20 gallons, "
            "horse 10-15 gallons, sheep/goat 1-4 gallons, pig 3-5 gallons, laying hen 500ml, turkey 800ml. "
            "Requirements double in hot weather and increase 50% for lactating animals. "
            "WATER QUALITY: Test annually for nitrates, bacteria, TDS, and pH. Cattle tolerate 3,000 ppm TDS; "
            "poultry less than 2,000 ppm. Blue-green algae in ponds can be fatal. Nitrates above 100 ppm cause problems. "

            "Check daily in winter as heater failures mean no water within hours. "
            "Tank capacity: provide enough for 2 days' supply in case of system failure. "

            "HYGIENE: Clean tanks weekly in summer (algae growth). Locate away from manure areas. "

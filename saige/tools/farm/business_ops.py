"""
Business-ops tools for Saige — mirrors the surface that Thaiyme exposes on the
main backend so Saige can answer accounting + event-hosting questions without
the user having to switch between agents.

Covered:
  - Accounting snapshot (AR/AP, recent invoices, last-30-day rev/spend)
  - List open invoices
  - Find customer (by name/company/email substring)
  - Recent payments (configurable look-back)
  - Event registrations (host-side: who registered, payment status)

Same access-scoping pattern as precision_ag.py: every business_id the user
mentions is verified against dbo.BusinessAccess for the current PeopleID
before any data is returned.

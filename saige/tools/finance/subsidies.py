Government subsidies / cost-share / grant finder (US federal).

Curated database of the major USDA and federal programs farmers can apply to.
Structured so the frontend can filter by: farm-type, practice category,
enterprise size, or region.

International programs (EU CAP, India PM-KISAN, Canada AgriStability) can
be added later — structure is identical.

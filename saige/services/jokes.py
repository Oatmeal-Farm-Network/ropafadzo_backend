"""
Saige's joke list. When a user asks for a joke, she calls tell_joke_tool().

The tool:
  1. Loads which joke indices this user has already heard (Firestore).
  2. Picks a random UNSEEN joke.
  3. Marks it as told and saves back to Firestore.
  4. If every joke has been told, resets the user's history and starts fresh
     (with a note so it doesn't feel like a glitch).

Storage: saige_joke_history/{people_id} document in the chat-history Firestore DB.

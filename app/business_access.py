"""Ownership guards for business-scoped endpoints.

Most routers take the business as a plain parameter and trust it, which lets any
caller read or change another business's records by changing the number. These
dependencies close that: the caller must hold the business in BusinessAccess
with Active = 1 — the same check delete_animal and the animal transfer endpoint
already make.

Two shapes, because the routers use two:

    # business_id arrives as a query parameter
    @router.get("/employees", dependencies=[Depends(require_business)])

    # business_id arrives inside the JSON body
    @router.post("/employees", dependencies=[Depends(require_business_body)])

Both are applied at the decorator, so route signatures and bodies stay as they
are. Reading the body in a dependency is safe: Starlette caches it, so the
endpoint's own body parameter still parses.

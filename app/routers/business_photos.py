"""Photo pages for a business, shown on its directory listing.

A business keeps several named pages -- "Our Ranch", "Facilities", "2026 Calf
Crop" -- each holding its own photos. Reads are public, since the pages appear
on the public directory listing. Writes require an active BusinessAccess row.

Photos are rows rather than Photo1..PhotoN columns: fixed slots would force the
cap into the schema, make reordering a column shuffle, and leave holes when a
middle photo is removed.

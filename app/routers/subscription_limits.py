"""
routers/subscription_limits.py

Enforces the per-package listing allowances stored on SubscriptionPackage
(MaxForSaleListings, MaxStudListings, MaxDirectoryListings, and for the LOA
packages MaxEquipmentListings, MaxJobPostings, MaxServiceListings).

How a business resolves to a package
------------------------------------
There is no BusinessID -> PackageID foreign key. When a package is assigned
(platform_subscriptions.assign_package) the package *name* is copied into
Business.SubscriptionTier, so that string is the only link available and this
module joins on it.

That join is deliberately strict, which matters because the shared database
holds legacy tier strings that predate the package catalog -- roughly 1,800
businesses sit on 'basic' and another 96 on 'Free'. Neither matches a
PackageName, so both resolve to "no package" and stay unlimited. Anything that
does not resolve to a package with a non-NULL limit is never restricted, so
Oatmeal Farm Network accounts are unaffected by this module.

One consequence worth remembering: naming a future package 'basic' or 'Free'
would retroactively cap every one of those legacy businesses.

NULL means unlimited. 0 means the plan excludes that listing type entirely.

Unit tests for livestock_knowledgebase module.

Fully isolated: no real database engine, no outbound network I/O, and no
TestClient/live-server dependency. Every boundary (DB engine, sockets) is
mocked so the suite runs deterministically, in-process, in well under a
second, matching the same isolation contract as the other *_unit.py suites.
